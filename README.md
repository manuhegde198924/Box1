- The flex CSS shorthand property is the combination of flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties. It is used to set the length of flexible items. The flex property is much more responsive and mobile-friendly. It is easy to position child elements and the main container. The margin doesnâ€™t collapse with the content margins. The order of any element can be easily changed without editing the HTML section.

Syntax:

flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis|auto|initial|inherit;

Property Values:

    flex-grow Property: A number that specifies, how much items will grow relative to the rest of the flexible items.
    flex-shrink Property: A number that specifies, how much items will shrink relative to the rest of the flexible items.
    flex-basis Property: It sets the length of items. Legal values of flex-basis are: auto, inherit, or a number followed by %, em, px, or any other length unit.
        flex-wrap Property: The CSS flex-wrap property is used to specify whether flex items are forced into a single line or wrapped onto multiple lines.

The flex property can be specified with the help of 1, 2 or 3 values:

    One-value syntax: the value should contain one of following:
        number: If it is represented as flex: <number> 1 0; then the value of flex-shrink, flex-basis will supposed to be 1 & 0 respectively.
        It can be specified by one of the keyword as auto, none or initial.
    Two-value syntax: It must contains the following values:
        The first value should be the number that will represent the flex-grow.
        The second value should contain one of the following:
            number: If it is number then it will represented as flex-shrink.
            a width with the valid value will represents the flex-basis.
    Three-value syntax: The values should be in the same order:
        first number represents the flex-grow.
        second number represents the flex-shrink.
        a width with the valid value will represents the flex-basis.
